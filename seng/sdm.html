 <h2>Our Software Development Methodology</h2>

 <h3>Background</h3>
 <p>A software development plan lists projects pending and develops a scheme and order by which
software can be usefully constructed. I will strive to discern an optimal logical order we can
use to develop software based on our current skill sets, tools, experience, time frame and
financial objectives. There is naturally an interest in developing a scheme that is financially
self sustaining without imposing too much sacrifice or strain on developers or management. This
means that we will either develop smaller systems first so that we will quickly have something
to sell or we will divide our larger products into individually salable modules. We will in principle strive to develop expert system based software, that is as close
to the cutting edge of research in this field as is possible without financial loss.</p>

 <p>In this plan I will develop not only a methodology for the development of individual products
but also seek to outline the order of development of products. It will become apparent as this
effort proceeds, precisely what skills we all have to develop, when we have to develop them and
what the content of our Knowledge Transfer Sessions will be.</p>

<h3>Methodology</h3>
<p>The primary purpose in using a well structured method for developing software is that we
    must make the process visible. Process visibility is key to any organized intellectual
    activity. It is possible for each of us to sit at our respective computers typing away all
    day without consulting or referring to each other, developing software that while
    functional is not inter-operable or consistent with any standard. We MUST adhere to
    standards (Open Standards, Internet Standards and CCITT (ITU-T) Standards) otherwise we
    cannot build on each others work. Further, based on our individual preferences we must
    develop reusable Objects/ Templates or Classes. At this point the easiest way to move
    forward, without all of us aspiring to be language lawyers is to use objects and
    standardize on a particular development language and platform. I will outline the steps and
    documents to be delivered at each step of the development process. This is a flexible list
    and will depend on the actual product being developed. I suggest that the list of documents
    to be delivered be outlined in one of the development documents:</p>
    
    <p> 
    <ol>
    <li>PRODUCT SPECIFICATION DOCUMENT:
       
        A Product Specification Document(PSD) is the first document to be created when a person has an idea for a new product or the enhancement of an already existing product. A PSD has the following elements:
        <ol>
       <li> PRODUCT NAME: Use a Codename for the Product, marketing will decide on a final name</li> 
       <li> PREAMBLE: This contains a management summary of the market that this product is
        intended to service, who some potential clients are, and a one paragraph
        description(suitable for non-techie marketers) of its features. </li>
        <li> FEATURE LIST: This is a preliminary Listing of the functionality that you think
        should be included in the product.</li>
        <li> COSTINGS: Include here such things as how long you think it may take to develop
        this product, what new tools we might need to buy to speed the product development
        cycle, how many developers it would take to achieve the goals you have outlined in the
        feature list. You might also want to give some idea of what you think the product will
        sell for, and approximately how many units you think can be sold. Nobody expects you to
        get the numbers absolutely right the first time off, so don't be too worried about the
        exact product delivery schedule, unit sales and so forth. That is reserved for another
        document. </li>
       <li>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS: In this section of your PSD give people some idea of
        competitive products, what they sell for, how many units have been sold and what you
        think the draw backs or impediments to its progress were. You might also want to attach
        some details on features you think we should implement that they haven't.

        <p>Now it is not a given that a product specification document will always lead to the
        development of a product, it is essentially a speculative and exploratory document. It
        is your purpose to demonstrate that a particular product has value and that we can
        develop it in a reasonable amount of time with tools that we may already have, and that
        the bottom line may justify a more in depth examination of the premises of your PSD.</p>

        <p>The PSD should be directed to the Technical Director (Nyimbi, at this
        point). The responsive document is and Authority to proceed (ATP)</p>.</li> 
        </ol></li> 
        
        <li> AUTHORITY TO PROCEED:
        An Authority to Proceed (ATP), is given by a line manager in consultation with all
        development/Marketing and Finance Staff in response to a particular PSD. It is a Node
        Document in that it spawns a whole series of other processes in different departments.
        The ATP is directed to the following parties:
        <ol>
           <li> Development:    Initiate the development process</li>
            <li>Finance:        Project Planning and costing sequence initiated</li>
            <li>Marketing:      Marketing Sequence Initiated</li>
        </ol>
        Even if the product idea dies at the PSD stage, we must establish it as a standard
        procedure that the originator of the idea receive some indication in writing/email as
        to why the PSD did not go through. It might for instance be required that the PSD
        undergo some refinements or adumbration before it can be accepted, in which case the
        return document must clearly indicate what more needs to be done. In order to forestall
        this entire thing blowing out of proportion and peoples Egos getting in the way, I will
        suggest that people writing a PSD put it out as a request for comment (RFC) first. An
        RFC as you will notice is at the head of the tree. Naturally this entire process must
        remain internal to us, and everybody must take reasonable care that internal
        documents remain internal.
        </li>
        
        <li>DEVELOPMENT DOCUMENTS:
        In order not to create too big a document, I have divided this section into the
        different document classes. Development documents refer to the documents expected from
        R and D in support of the product development effort. Since the development of different
        applications requires different documents, I will indicate only the most generic
        document set.
        <ol>
        <li>->ARCH: This is the Architecture document for the product. It will indicate in depth
        the required functionality, the application architecture, Modules expected to be built
        and how code reuse may be optimized. This is generally the the most thought intensive
        process in the entire programming effort. It will be required that based on a
        comparison of similar products from other vendors we explain why we are leaving out
        certain functionality, if any. In this document we also define the User Interface
        Standards, Message Passing Conventions, Tests for Robustness and error/exception
        trapping. Define the tools we are going to use (CASE), algorithms we will use and why,
        language we are going to use and why, tools we need to buy/acquire/build etc. We will
        identify any common objects across any modules and define an API/Interface for each
        that provides the greatest opportunity for reuse.</li>

        <li>->MOD: This is the Module definition document. In the module definition document we
        clearly define the function of each module, it's interfaces and calling conventions and
        we further show that each functional feature in the architecture document is clearly
        mapped onto some module. If the module has a user interface component we specify what
        information we will need from the end-user, if any. This is to facilitate the
        development of UI by a User Interface Specialist. The Application Logic must be clearly
        indicated. NO, we don't want flow charts or ancient stuff like that, we do however
        require a process analysis for the module. (You might want to have a look at
        ProcessAnalyst \\Akili\Devtool\DBDev\PDesign\PDPa6.exe) If the application is a
        database application  then this is the point where you give the Conceptual Data Model.</li>

       <li> -> DCSPEC: This is the documentation Specification for the product. Indicate here what
        documentation will be needed for distribution with the final product. Help files/Man
        pages, User Guides , Tech Support Guides, Marketing Brochures (Nobody can develop these
        better than a techie!!), Implementation Guides, etc.</li>

        <li>-> QASSUR: You guessed right, Even before you begin coding you must indicate how to
        determine that the product meets spec. Indicate here key indicators of performance,
        concurrency of users, load up time, stay alive periods, configuration time scales, user
        skill required etc.</li>

        <li>-> CODING: This is when we do the actual programming of the product. Your documentation
        of the code cannot be over stressed, somebody else must be able to read your code and
        understand what you are doing. If you have a global variable (you shouldn't!!) indicate
        what it is used for, in your declaration of each function you must indicate the
        datatype, transformations and side effects of both its inputs and what its outputs.
        Further, if you go back and change the function at some later time, DO NOT DELETE your
        old comments, ADD to them indicating what changes you have made and why. This latter is
        important so that you don't break some poor guys code. I would further suggest that you
        name your functions in some meaningful and standard way across all the code that you
        touch, preface your unit/file with a standard header that indicates what you're doing,
        and to help people find out where what is being done, create a manifest of the files in
        a directory indicating which file has which function. I know this is really boring, but
        I'm sure you know what a nightmare it is reading code that is not properly commented,
        so lets do it right. Avoid Flaky algorithms of dubious repute,</li>

        <li>-> SUPNOTES: Support Notes are an honest to goodness assessment on your parts of which
        functions you think can be improved, which algorithms you're not sure about and which
        modules you think are flaky. If you're not sure of something, the support notes are the
        place to let people know what's up. Include here any references to books/magazines or
        journals where you got code snippets so that somebody can find out where to seek help
        if they're modifying your code.</li>

        <li>-> EVOLUTION REPORT: Finally you have got the application out of the way, in time and
        on schedule, because you planned it so well. Now if you didn't implement some features
        or you have lately discovered how you can improve the product, you short circuit the
        whole PSD process and write an evolution report. Here tell everybody where you are
        going with the application, Bug reports, feature enhancements etc. Generally Speaking
        you are giving a report of how the product development went, what problems you
        encountered in it's development and generally being chatty about what you have done.</li>
          </ol>  
        </li>
        
        <li>FINANCE DOCUMENTS:
        Finance has the onerous task of making sure that the resources are available to get the
        job done. Their task is the prediction of Project Implementation costs, Possible Return
        on Investment, The determination of Minimum Unit sales to break even, the determination
        of how to best capitalize on a product financially and most importantly determining
        what the profit per unit is (if any). Here is a delineation of the documents that must
        be developed and what is in each (briefly):
        <ol>
        <li>PJ-COSTING: Based on the assessment of the development team, and finances knowledge of
        the reliability of the time estimates, and requirements,the Project Accountant
        (Leonard) develops a project costing analysis. The project costing analysis gives a
        measure of how much money it will take to actually develop a particular product, based
        on personnel emoluments, rent, overheads, consumables, packaging and marketing costs,
        media costs, manual printing and all that sort of thing. If the project team developing
        a product has an impact on any other team, the project accountant must also assess the
        financial implications of lost productivity for members of other teams. Based on all
        the factors above, Management (Okumu in this instance), decides on how best to move
        forward with this effort. It is the task of Line Managers to assure that there are
        sufficient other income streams to meet the cost of all development currently taking
        place. The calculation works like this: Personnel are a calculable cost, normally a
        well defined progression, so are overheads and consumables. The actual project costs
        differ with the development time table. We must, given these constraints, work out
        what-if scenarios that optimize productivity with least immediate financial impact e.g.
        What if we extended the duration of the project so that people could put some work in
        other projects that are immediately bringing in money, can we meet all our costs and
        still fund the ongoing development  m,.? If we do that, by how much do we extend the
        development period and what are the ramifications vis a vis the competition? {Sounds
        pretty complex, but it isn't really, once you have a little experience. (An expert
        System would be really great for this!!!)} Now based upon projected sales after the
        completion of development, the PJ-Costing gives a ROI projection for various prices per
        unit of product. The actual ROI is going to be determined by market forces (how much is
        the competition selling similar products for ?, How does increasing price reduce sales
        or is the product price resistant ? etc.).</li>

        <li>PJ-TIMELINE: This is by far the most mathematically interesting document, It outlines
        the actual expense/ per unit time over the development period for a number of
        scenarios. Sounds simple but its some pretty cool math, I can tell you. If you're
        interested it even involves some pretty cool math and game theory. Leonard will have his work
        cut out here!!!</li>

        <li>PJ-PROJECTIONS: More realistic calculations of ROI and all that sort of thing.
        Essentially what is being looked at here is the calculation of profit per period based
        on marketing costs , Marketing effectiveness of different means of knowledge
        distribution, patenting costs, different licensing options and financial implications
        thereof, recovery of costs incurred based on interest paid on funds.</li>
        </ol>    
        </li>
        
        <li>MARKETING DOCUMENTS
        Marketing is essentially a function that we have outsourced. It is
        however very important that we liaise closely with our colleagues in order to ensure
        the best possible implementation and deployment of our products. To this end we have a
        set of marketing support documents that we must develop. In principle the finance and
        documentation sections are responsible for this task. The
        documents are as follows (I'll be as brief as possible):
        
        <ol>MIP: This is a Marketing Introduction Plan. A MIP is a complex and large document that states everything we know and feel about a product. I have broken down my understanding
        of this document into sections and included them below.
           
           <li> MANAGEMENT SUMMARY:
                This section draws into one overall summary the key issues affecting the
                proposed product introduction, restates the implications to be addressed and
                the marketing strategies.</li>
           <li> PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:
                This section is not intended to provide an exhaustive description of the
                product.  It must, however, allow a judgment to be made as to the likely
                achievement of the volume and market share objectives based upon product
                attributes.</li>
            <li>TARGET MARKETS:
                In this section should be documented and quantified those markets selected for
                the product, together with the rationale.</li>
            <li> DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS:
                Consideration must be included on the state of development of the various
                channels open to us in the proposed markets.</li>
            <li> COMPETITION AND POSITIONING:
                This section deals with the marketing environment of the product, identifying
                its competition and positioning</li>
            <li> PRICING STRATEGY:
                This section describes the pricing basis for each product separately to be
                available for sale.</li>
            <li> COMMERCIAL PROFILE:
                This section details the sales forecast of the product shipment over the next
                four quarters.  The time interval may be different for some products with high
                costs or long gestation periods.</li>
            <li> PROMOTIONAL PLAN:
                The promotional plan will vary according to the stage of, the product life
                cycle, the distribution strategy and the overall marketing approach.</li>
            <li> SOFTWARE STRATEGY:
                This section looks at what is available against what is required by the end
                users (as well as software developers) in the Kenyan market.</li>
            <li> SUPPORT STRATEGY:
                This section anticipates the support requirements for the product over the
                short and long term.  it should address the fitness for purpose of the existing
                local, regional or international support infrastructure.</li>
            <li> SERVICE OPTIONS:
                This section covers the Customer Services options that are available locally,
                and describes how such services are to be implemented and applied for the
                product.</li>
            <li> LOGISTICS:
                This section describes the ordering procedure, the delivery process, the
                contractual terms, and the upgrade requirement.</li>
            <li> DOCUMENTATION:
                This section identifies all available documentation for the product.</li>
            <li> CERTIFICATIONS:
                Some products or their components may be subject to controls by standards,
                local authorities, etc.  This section checks out these restrictions.</li>
            <li> LAUNCH PROGRAM:
                This section provides details of the program and all the activities
                contributing or related to the product launch.</li>
            <li> TRAINING REQUIREMENTS:
                This section identifies the requirements and plans the training schedules for
                sales and all support staff.</li>
            <li> REVIEW PROCEDURE:
                This section defines the procedure for carrying out the formal product review.</li>
            <li> RISKS AND ISSUES
                This section states the assumptions, risks and issues regarding the
                introduction of the product.</li>
            
        </ol>
        </li>
       <p> MA: This is an authorization to market, it has principally the same format as an ATP in the product development cycle.</p>

            <p>COMPETE: This is a detailed survey of the competition and what their products. In
            this document we do a competitive analysis, forestall any attacks on our product,
            prepare performance bench marks, do a cost/feature analysis etc. The thoroughness
            of this document is left to the imagination of the person writing it.</p>

            <p>CLIST: A Potential Client List, What else could it be ?</p>
