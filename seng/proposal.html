 <h3>Background and Motivation</h3>

 <div class="todo">
  TODO: This is a living document and we will continue to update it as we get more insight into the problem domain. I full expect that as the design phasre finishes, we shall have another iteration of this high-level document. The questions we seek to anser are: <ul>
      <li>What are the needs or problems that we are trying to
  address? </li>
  <li>Why do these needs (still) exist?</li>
  <li>Why are these problems
  worth solving?</li>
  <li>Who is the customer?</li>
  </ul>

  <dt>The setting and history behind Tenda</dt> 
 
  <dd class="sample1">
  <p>The GoK makes thousands of purchases every week. By policy it has been established that 30% of all procurement is reserved for Youth, Women and Persons with Disabilities. The effectiveness of this provision has been mitigated by implementational difficulties. </p>
  <p>One of the principal challenges to the success of the AGPO inititive (as it is called) is that the Youth, Women and Persons with disabilities do NOT know about these opportunities when they arise. These opportunities (when they are made public) are published in newspapers. In Kenya newspapers are of very limited circulation. Kenya has <a href="http://www.pressreference.com/Gu-Ku/Kenya.html">4 Newspapers</a> with national coverage, with a total circulation fo 250,000. I a population just north of 40M people, it is a trite to say that nobody reads newspapers! In 2014, Four million Kenyans, roughly 10 percent of the population,  engaged daily in social media activities with 570 million tweets expected by the end of 2014 and more than 50 thousand new twitter accounts predicted at the same period of time. This is the result of the research by The Digital Rand on “The State of Social Media in Kenya” which was published in 2014. According to statistics on Social Bakers, majority of these users age between 18-24 and 25-34 years with 64% of them being male and 36% female. </p>
  <p>Tenda will provide a means for this online/non-newspaper reading population to get information in tenders and government procurement on their smartphones.</p>
  
  </dd>


  <dt>What is the problem to be addressed?</dt> 
  
  <dd class="sample1">There are hundreds of government procuring entities, each with its own website and newspaper advertisements. (Each university, college, parastatal, school advertizes independently). If a youthful or female entrepreneur wanted to keep track of these hundreds of website to find out if a deal they were interested was available, it would be a onerous, timeconsuming daily activity.
    There is a need for a faster way for users to find information of interest, immediately it becomes avalable.</dd>


  <dt>Some current approaches to this problem</dt> 
 
  <dd class="sample1">Users can tell each other about tenders, but that is not
  scalable because it depends on manual steps by people who may not be
  motivated or honest in their evaluations.  There are  some
  tender directory web sites, but they are not automated so they are
  always out of date and do not rate the quality of the tenders.
 <p>The treasury tender website list tenders that have expired.</p>
  <ul>
   <li><a href="http://supplier.treasury.go.ke/site/tenders.go/index.php/public/tenders/page:1">Treasury Tender Website</a></li>
   <li><a href="http://www.ppoa.go.ke/tenders/gok-tenders">PPOA Tender Listing (links right back to the useless Treasury list!)</a></li>
  </ul>
 
  </dd>


  <dt>Why this problem worth solving or worth solving better</dt> 
 
  <dd class="sample1">A better tender directory service would
  be valuable because it could greatly increase availability of business, entrepreneur satisfaction satisfaction and
  allow them to spend more time responding to tenders and executing work and less time searching.
  <p>The lack of competition, opaque processes, and back room deals is the very source of public procurement corruption. We can help eradicate corruption by bringing these opportrunities to light to a larger community of entrepreneurs, speccifically the under-represented.</p>
  </dd>


  <dt>How Tenda will be better than previous approaches</dt> 
 
  <dd class="sample1">We add innovative new features.  Our tender
  directory will be larger an more detailed.  We will offer built-in
  tools for managing responses, searching for sepecific opportunities, get real time alerts when opportunities emerge and organizing consortia to repsond to Tenders
  nights or tournaments.</dd>
  
  <dd class="sample2">Our system will have substantially different functionality, and it will have much better maintainability, scalability, and
  security.</dd>

<!--
  <dd class="sample3">Our system will have similar functionality, but
  it is specifically aimed at a market segment that is not 
  served by competing products.</dd>
-->

<!--
  <dd class="sample4">This is a "me-too" product that will go
  head-to-head with very similar competing products in the same
  market.  The market is large enough that we can be very happy with a
  share of it.  Our unique competitive advantages are in non-product
  area of our business such as sales, marketing, partnerships,
  support, training, etc.  The product will have some simple built-in
  "hooks" that leverage those advantages.</dd>

 <h3>Goal</h3>
 <dl>

  <dt>The goal of this project</dt>
 
<!--
  <div class="tip">
   TIP: This should be relatively short since you can reference terms
   defined above.
  </div>
-->
 
  <dd class="sample1">This project will produce a real-time engine for tender alerts 
  that allows users to quickly find, evaluate,respond and track tenders as they emerge. We will develop a analytical engine to track likelyhood of success, and permit users to form consortia with like-minded people to respond to tenders.
  </dd>
 
 
  <dt>The defining features and benefits of this product set</dt>
 
  <dd>
  <ul class="sample1">
   <li>Reusable website engine with functionality for searching for tenders, creating responses,
   editing, deleting, searching, categorizing, browsing, rating, and
   commenting on Tenders.  This automates all tender response operations and ensures
   that users will always find information that is automatically
   up-to-date.</li>
 
   <li>The tender alert engine will have a highly configurable
   appearance that allows it to be used by visually impaired persons, people with limited articulation, and configurable  look and feel.
   This allows the reusable website engine to have a high-quality
   appearance that is just as appropriate for the target audience.</li>
 
   <li>The engine will be secure and only allow users with the
   proper permissions to respond, edit, delete, or join a consortium.  We will use the power of social media at the core of our design. </li>
  </ul>

  TODO: Replace the sample text below with a clear statement of the
  scope of your project.  What are the high-level things that you plan
  to do, and that you will not do?  What are your important
  simplifying assumptions?  Try to guard against reasonable
  misunderstandings that might arise if you did not explain the scope.
  It can take the form of a paragraph, bullet list, in/out list, and/or
  UML context diagram.

 <h3>Risks and Rewards</h3>
 <dl>

  <div class="todo">
   TODO: Briefly list and rank major risks.  Risks are detailed in the
   draft <a href="plan.html">project plan</a>.  For this proposal
   document, you should select the most important risks from the
   project plan and explain them in non-technical terms.
  </div>

  <dt>Main risks of this project</dt>
 
  <dd class="sample1">
   <ol>
    <li>There is a potential conflict between the goals of a
    high-quality appearance and one that is completely customizable.  We
    can only succeed if users find the web site useful and appealing.  We already have a design in mind that will
    address this risk and we will review it with a UX Expert</li>
  
    <li>There are significant technical difficulties in building a web
    site and web application.  This will be a risk because one person on
    our team has much experience with the relevant tools and
    technologies.  Although the others will learn, we will certainly
    make some mistakes and suboptimal choices.  We will address this
    risk by scoping the project such that we have enough time to train
    and to review the design and implementation.</li>
  
    <li>The schedule for this project is very short.  We will manage
    this by planning a conservatively scoped functional core and series
    of functional enhancements that can be individually slipped to later
    releases if needed.</li>
   </ol>
  </dd>

 
  <dt>When Tenda succeeds (as it must)</dt>

  <dd class="sample1">If we accomplish the elements of our plan, our
  tender directory engine will replace the existing  directory
  websites and generate traffic which will result in increased citizen participation in government procurement.  Our ability to
  overcome the challenges above will determine time to market, the
  speed of adoption, the amount of web traffic, and thus the generated
  revenue over time.</dd>
