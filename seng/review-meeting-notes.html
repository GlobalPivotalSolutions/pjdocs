 <div class="sample1">
 <p>We started on time with 3 members and the other team members
 arrived shortly thereafter.</p>

 <p>In the first hour of the review meeting, we went over issues that
 the team had entered individually.  Most of the issues raised
 questions about the error handling capability of Hello.java, but
 there were also issues about multi-user robustness requirements and
 UI.</p>

 <p>In the second hour, we read through all of the methods of
 HelloStream.java.  All team members agreed that they understood each
 method and thought is was correct before we moved on to the next
 method. We raised issues of consistency between the constructors in
 that class and other classes.  The checklist was helpful in
 identifying the fact that we needed to implement hash() and equals().
 All raised issues were entered into the issue tracker and marked with
 the word "review".</p>
 
 <p>Although, some issues were found, we do not feel that Hello.java
 and HelloStream.java need to be inspected again.  HelloPanel was not
 inspected, it still needs review.</p>
