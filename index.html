  <dt>What problem does the Tenda project wiki address?</dt>

  <dd>
    <p> Software development projects require a lot of "paperwork" in
  the form of requirements documents, design documents, test plans,
  schedules, checklists, release notes, etc.  Trying to keep track of all the documents can be a royal pain, so we are going to use a sort of wiki to keep track of all the work that we do. Using this project wiki will ensure that this project is properly managed. </p>
  
      <p>   <b>We are operating to extremely tight timelines and we cannot afford a mis-step.</b> So this technical rollout plan outlines the activities and engineering decisions that have been taken, the methodology we are using, and the timelines and deliverables from each team member. We will try to give a rationale for each proposed decision and some background on why we have chosen a specific path. <b>Folk: Documentation is important - If we reach a verbal decision the affected functional lead should update this wiki with the relevant notes and documents.</b> Don't tell us stuff from textbooks, we can read that as well as you - give a reference or citation, <i>don't quote or copy paste</i></p>
 </dd>

  <dt>What is the goal of this documentation effort?</dt>
  <dd>
      We want a:
      <ul>
          <li>Reproducible process for creating reliable software</li>
          <li>Visibility into the development process</li>
          <li>Best Practice </li>
          <li>We want to limit the DevOps challenges in deployment</li>
          <li>Maintainability and rapid evolution to satisfy market requirements</li>
      </ul>
  </dd>

 <dt>Key features that define the Tenda Document Set (DocSet)</dt>

 <dd>
  <ul>
      <li> We <b>ONLY</b> use HTML and text based formats so that we are not continuously changing tools from coding to dcumentation. That is why we use LaTeX and HTML for documentation. if you use MS word or some such - Fie on you, <i>Most of us won't read it, our computers are busy enough as it is without firing up yet another application</i></li>
   <li>High-quality Documentation. (Be as thorough as you can be) If you use or do something new or innovative, please point it out here so that the rest of the team can see what it is</li>

   <li>We use standardized documents for <i>many</i> common software engineering
   processes.  Including:
    <ul>
     <li>Project proposal </li>
     <li>Project plan (use TaskJuggler) </li>
     <li>Use cases (use <a href="http://bpmn.sourceforge.net/"> Yaoqiang BPMN Editor </a>)  </li>
     <li>QA plan</li>
     <li>Design templates</li>
     <li>System test case </li>
     <li>Release checklists</li>
    </ul>
   </li>

  </ul>

 <h3>Scope</h3>

<dl>
 <dt>What is the scope of this project?</dt>

 <dd>
  <p> We are realizing not just software, but a SYSTEM. It involves People (Civil Servants, Users, and Us), Processes (which we must try to make as easy as possible) and Technology (what we are building). We are building a system to surface government procurement to the general population, to facilitate broad participation in Government procurement, and hopefully build a reliable, trustworthy database of products, prices, actors and activities that we can use to study trends and general tendencies in our country.</p>
  <p>We are building an Open Source System - Anybody will be able to see how we have built this and hopefully use our code for other purposes. (So: No flippant or personal comments in the code) </p>
 </dd>

 <dt>What are the high-level assumptions or ground rules for the project?</dt>

 <dd>
  <ul>
    <li>We will use only open source technologies and tools</li>
    <li>We are developing an open source product</li>
    <li>The reusltant products will be freely available to anybody to use</li>
    <li>Security of the data is important</li>
    <li>Don't re-invent the wheel</li>
    <li>When the design is finished we will have a check-in every other day</li>
    <li>The Project plan says you have Sunday's off (but you should know better)</li>
    <li>We have very little slack in our project plan (2 weeks) - Marketing and Meeting will take up most of it, not development (You have been warned)</li>
  </ul>
 </dd>
</dl>




 <h3>Status</h3>
<dl>
 <dt>What is the status of this project?</dt>
 
 <dd> Still in active, daily development: <br />
 We have made many estimations based on years of software engineering practise.  Feel free to add to them, modify them and commit changes back to the git repository. Kindly annotate any changes and the rationale for such changes</dd>
